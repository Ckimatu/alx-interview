program that solves the N queens problem
Usage: nqueens N
    If the user called the program with the wrong
    number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N,
    followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    If N is not an integer, print N must be a number,
    followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
    followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    One solution per line
    Format: see example
    You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module
